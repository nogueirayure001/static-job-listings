# Frontend Mentor - Job listings with filtering

## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge is to build out this job listing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Filter job listings based on the categories

### Filtering

The data will be pulled from a [data.json](./src/data/data.json) file and dynamically added.

To add a filter, the user needs to click on the tablets on the right-side of the listing on desktop or the bottom on mobile. For each filter added, only listings containing all selected filters will be returned.
